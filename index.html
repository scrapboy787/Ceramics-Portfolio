        <img src="img/box 1.jpg" alt=" box 1 image">
        <p>This is a container I made to store some niter/saltpetre/potassium nitrate. It is glazed with a poo bear colour glaze as a base, and tuxedo black glaze for the symbol, both are Stroke & Coat brand glaze.</p>

        <img src="img/Box2.jpg" alt="Box 2 image">
        <p>This is not entirely my project. A friend made it but when it was fired some other unglazed piece exploded and got shraptnil stuck to it, so she gave it to me. I sanded and filed down the shraptnil and glazed over it with Tuxedo black from Stroke&coat. Then I put the symbol for charcoal compound on the sides of it with Cotton Tail White glaze also Stroke&coat brand. I intend on using this container to store charcoal compound in it.</p>

        <img src="img/Horn.jpg" alt="Unicorn Horn Plate">
        <p>This is a plate I made as a decoration to be attached to my appothacary cabnet. It is a unicorn horn it reprezents an appothacary work and expertiese because of the myth that a unicorn can heal any injury even death. Unfortionaly it warped during drying, and even more while being fired in the kiln. I Glazed it with the Obsidian Jungle Gem glaze and filled in the symbol with a gold NEWELL brand paint pen.</p>

        <img src="img/pumpkin.jpg" alt="Pumpkin Sculpture">
        <p>This is a piece I made while at EK's Art Barn. It's a pumpkin that I spent a okay amount of effort and time into. The back of it exploded and the stem came off while firing. I glued the stem back together and reattached it, but sa for the back side there is nothing I can do to fix it. The kind folks at EK,s Art Barn glazed it for me, so I dont know exaxtly what glaze they used. </p>

        <img src="img/plant plate 2.jpg" alt="Plate image 2" id="double">
        <p>This is a plate I made using a technique called <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjanK-4qMOLAxWs5MkDHWP0KxUQFnoECC0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMishima_ware&usg=AOvVaw2IIH51XGzaNPkZVLxPMQXE&opi=89978449" target="_blank">mishima</a>. I made it to collect the water that comes out of the botton of a pot with a christmas cactus in it. I formed the lip without a mold, I waited until it was leather hard then pinched and bent the edge. It's glazed with a cotton tail white and peri twinkle blue glazes from Stroke&Coat.</p>

        <img src="img/20250214_071344.jpg" alt="Aqua tofana container">
        <p>This is a container I made to store some Aqua Tofana/Arsenic Trioxide. It is made with a coil technique and then covered up with some more clay. The lid had to be made twice because the first one didn't fit. The inside is glazed with a mixture of candy apple red and tuxedo black, the outside is just tuxedo black. the symbol on the lid is done with a gold paint pen from NEWELL, and then covered up with clear glue to seal it and pervent the gold from wairing off.</p>
